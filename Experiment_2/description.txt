This code creates a clean, modern-looking webpage 
for a basic banking interface. It displays a central white card
that shows your account balance in a light blue box. 
Below the balance, it places two buttons side-by-side
a green "Deposit" button and a red "Withdraw" button.
Of course! Here's a simple, point-by-point explanation of what the code does.

How html is used here : 
The code creates a main white box (.bank-container) to hold everything.

Inside this box, there's a light blue div to show the account balance.

There's also a container (.btn-group) that holds the two buttons together.

The two buttons, "Deposit" and "Withdraw," are given different class names so they can have different colors (green and red).

How CSS is used in the code :
Basic Setup: The code first removes all default browser spacing to ensure the page looks consistent everywhere.

Centering the Box: It uses CSS to place the main white box perfectly in the center of the screen, both vertically and horizontally.

Arranging the Buttons: The "Deposit" and "Withdraw" buttons are set up to appear side-by-side with a neat gap between them.

Hover Effect: A simple effect is added so that the buttons change color slightly when you move your mouse over them.

Mobile-Friendly Design: If the screen is narrow (like on a phone), the code automatically stacks the buttons on top of each other so they are easier to tap.
