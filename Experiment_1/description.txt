Through this HTML lesson,
I learned how to structure a basic web
form using the <form> tag. I implemented 
various input fields such as text, email, and
number, and linked them with <label> elements
to enhance accessibility. The lesson also 
demonstrated how to use built-in browser
 validation through attributes like required, 
 minlength, and max.
